/*
Part 1: 

*Context:* Say we have login data in the table logins: 

| user_id | date       |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | 2018-07-01 |
| 234     | 2018-07-02 |
| 3       | 2018-07-02 |
| 1       | 2018-07-02 |
| ...     | ...        |
| 234     | 2018-10-04 |

*Task:* Write a query that gets the number of retained users per month. In this case, retention for a given month is defined as the number of users who logged in that month who also logged in the immediately previous month. 

Part 2: 

*Task:* Now weâ€™ll take retention and turn it on its head: Write a query to find how many users last month did not come back this month. i.e. the number of churned users.
